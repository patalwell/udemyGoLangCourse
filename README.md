#udemyGoLangCourse

This repository contains assigments and solutions from Todd McLeod's Udemy course on GoLang: 
<i>Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language </i> https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/

I'd highly recommend the course to busy software engineers juggling multiple other assignments and languages, as the instructor does an incredible job of detailing the ins and outs of the language specification and providing assignments that help one quickly transition from other languages like Java or Python. 

## Requirements:

1. You have go lang installed and at least version 1.12.5
e.g. `go version -> go version go1.12.5 darwin/amd64`
2. To install `Go` be sure to check out the official documentation here: https://golang.org/doc/install
Mac users may also use brew to install `Go` via 
```
//Installing Go on a Mac

brew update
brew install go
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your designated GoPath e.g. `go get https://github.com/patalwell/udemyGoLangCourse.git`
